# Classes / Objects

* class is a blueprint for creating objects.
* `static` variables means that variable is belong to the class
* method is a special function that works within a class

> file class Animal.cs:

```csharp
namespace firstcsharp
{
    class Animal
    {
        public string name;
        public string sound;
        static int numOfAnimals = 0;

        // constructor
        public Animal()
        {
            name = "No Name";
            sound = "No Sound";
            numOfAnimals++;
        }

        // constructor overloading
        public Animal(string name = "No Name")
        {
            this.name = name;
            this.sound = "No Sound";
            numOfAnimals++;
        }

        public Animal(string name = "No Name", string sound = "No Sound")
        {
            this.name = name;
            this.sound = sound;
            numOfAnimals++;
        }

        // method
        public void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("{0} says {1}", this.name, this.sound);
        }

        public static int GetNumAnimals()
        {
            return numOfAnimals;
        }

    }
}

```

> file class ShapeMath.cs

```csharp
namespace firstcsharp
{
    class ShapeMath
    {
        public static double GetArea(string shape = "", double length1 = 0, double length2 = 0)
        {
            if (String.Equals("Rectangle", shape, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            {
                return length1 * length2;
            } else if (String.Equals("Triangle", shape, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            {
                return length1 * (length2 / 2);
            } else if (String.Equals("Circle", shape, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            {
                return 3.14159 * Math.Pow(length1, 2);
            } else
            {
                return -1;
            }
        } 
    }
}

```

Let's use that Animal Class and static utilities class:
```csharp
public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("----------");
        Animal fox = new Animal()
        {
            name = "Red",
            sound = "Raaw"
        };
        Console.WriteLine("# of Animals {0}", Animal.GetNumAnimals());
        Console.WriteLine("Area of Rectangle: {0}",
            ShapeMath.GetArea("rectangle", 5, 6));
    }
}
```
<br>

Result:
```terminal
----------
# of Animals 1
Area of Rectangle: 30
```


# Struct
```csharp
public class Program
{

    // -- FUNCTIONS --


    // -- END OF FUNCTIONS


    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // create rectangle using struct
        Rectangle rect1;
        rect1.length = 200;
        rect1.width = 50;
        Console.WriteLine("Area of rect1L {0}", rect1.Area());

        Rectangle rect2 = new Rectangle(100, 40);
        rect2 = rect1;
        rect1.length = 33;
        Console.WriteLine("Rect2.length: {0}", rect2.length);
    }

    struct Rectangle
    {
        public double length;
        public double width;

        public Rectangle(double l = 1, double w = 1) { length = l; width = w; }
        public double Area()
        {
            return length * width;
        }
    }
}
```

Hasil:
```terminal
Area of rect1L 10000
Rect2.length: 200
```

# When to Use Class? 
Classes are best used when you need to represent more complex objects, such as real-world entities like cars, people, or animals. They are also useful when you need to create hierarchies of objects, where one class inherits from another.

You should also use a class when you need to work with large amounts of data, such as when you’re working with a database or other external data source.

Another situation where classes are useful is when you need to encapsulate functionality and data together. By creating a class, you can group related methods and properties into a single unit, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.

Additionally, classes can be used to implement **interfaces**, which define a set of methods that a class must implement. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in your code.



# When to Use Struct?
Structs are best used when you need to represent simple data types, such as **integers, strings**, or other basic data types. They are also useful when you need to work with **large datasets**, such as arrays or lists, where performance is critical.

You should also use a struct when you need to pass a small amount of data to a method, and you want to avoid the overhead of passing a reference to a class.

Another scenario where structs can be useful is when you need to create a **lightweight object** that doesn’t require inheritance or polymorphism. Since structs are value types, they can be easily copied and passed around without the need for complex memory management.

# Nullable Types
Sometimes data types does not have null.

so you need more extra sign:

```csharp
public class Program
{

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int? randNum = null; // nullable value
        if (randNum == null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("randNum is null");
        }

        // check null in another ways
        if (!randNum.HasValue)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("randNum is null!!");
        }

    }
}
```

Result: <br>
```terminal
randNum is null
randNum is null!!
```
